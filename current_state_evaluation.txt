May 30th: KNN clustering in place for iterating over [2,n-1] clusters and compare results of documents in the same cluster often.
Disadvantages:
	- Unclear to learn when the optimum number of clusters is reached
	- No automatic evaluation script, manual sampling instead.


June 6th: NN up and running, achieving baseline like score of 94%. 
Disadvantages: 
	- sparse matrix as input for NN, creating high baseline

June 13th: NN with new features (character embeddings), achieving scores of 75-85%
Disadvantages:
	- Baseline unclear
