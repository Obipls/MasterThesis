<h2><a name="problems"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</font></h2>
<h3>Installation</font></h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>I cannot see the Bibtex toolbar</b></font></dt>
  <dd>(a) You must restart Word if it was already running when you installed the 
    bibtex.dot template<br>
  (b) Check that the template was copied into the correct startup folder: 
    within Microsoft Word click <font face="Arial">Tools&gt;&gt;Options&gt;&gt;File 
    Locations&gt;&gt;Startup&gt;&gt;Modify</font> in order to discover where the Word 
    Startup folder is. Then click &quot;Cancel&quot; to avoid changing it to something 
    else.<br>
  (c) When downloading the template, Internet Explorer sometimes changes it 
    from a template file to a document file. From within Word, open the file and 
    then select &quot;<font face="Arial">Save As</font>&quot; and save it in the Word Startup folder as a file type 
    &quot;<font face="Arial">Document Template (*.dot)</font>&quot;.<br>
  (d) Check that the add-in is enabled. In <b>Word 2002/3</b>, click &quot;<font face="Arial">Tools-&gt;Templates</font>&quot; 
  and &quot;<font face="Arial">Add-ins</font>&quot; and ensure that <font face="Arial">
  bibtex4word.dot</font> is listed with a check mark. In <b>Word 2007</b>, click 
  the Microsoft Office Button (at top left), then &quot;<font face="Arial">Word 
  Options</font>&quot; and &quot;<font face="Arial">Add-Ins</font>&quot;; in the Manage box at 
  the bottom, select &quot;<font face="Arial">Templates</font>&quot; and click &quot;<font face="Arial">Go</font>&quot;; 
  ensure that <font face="Arial">bibtex4word.dot</font> is listed with a check 
  mark.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Bad Behaviour</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Bibliography disappears when it is <b>updated</b></dt>
	<dd>If you install the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> package 
	after installing MikTex, Bibtex4Word will use the wrong version of 
	bibtex.exe. Possible fixes are:<br>
	(a) use the &quot;+&quot; style flag<br>
	(b) alter the PATH environment variable so that MikTex precedes cygwin<br>
	(c) delete or rename the cygwin bibtex.exe file<br>
	(d) Specify the correct bibtex file as the <span class="style1">BIBEXE</span> 
	environment variable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. <span class="style1">BIBEXE=C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 
	2.8\miktex\bin\bibtex.exe</span></dd>
</dl>
<h3>Selection of Styles</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>I created a new style but BibTeX cannot find it</b></dt>
  <dd>If you create a new style, you need to run texhash from a command window 
  in order to update BibTeX's list of files. You can ulso update it by 
	following: Programs-&gt; MikTex 2.x-&gt; Maintenance(Admin)-&gt; Settings(Admin) and 
	then clicking on &quot;Refresh FNDB&quot;.<br>
	You can verify that style xxx is visible to MikTex by typing &quot;kpsewhich 
	xxx.bst&quot; from a command window.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Formatting of Citations</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>I want the citations to have parentheses instead of brackets, be 
  superscripts, etc</b></dt>
  <dd>The detailed formatting of the citations is controlled by the style flags 
  whose use is described in the <a href="b4w_using.html#Flags">user guide</a>. 
  Thus a style <font face="Arial">plain</font> will use square brackets whereas
  <font face="Arial">plain/(</font> will use round parentheses and
  <font face="Arial">plain/(^</font> will use round parentheses and 
  superscripts.</dd>
  <dt><b>Parentheses adjacent to a citation disappear when I refresh the 
	bibliography</b></dt>
  <dd>To avoid leaving unwanted parentheses in the document under some 
	circumstances, Bibtex4Word deliberately gobbles up any parentheses that are 
	immediately adjacent to a citation. To avoid this, insert a zero-width space 
	between the citation and the parenthesis that you wish to preserve. How to 
	enter a zero-width space sadly depends on the version of Word you are using 
	as well as the font and language settings, the easiest way in 
	Word2002+ is to type 200B in the document and then hold down Alt and type X.&nbsp; If you 
	have enabled the display of non-printing characters, the zero-width space is 
	displayed on the screen as a square within a square but it will not appear 
	when printed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="Formatting_of_Bibliography">Formatting of Bibliography</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>The author names appear twice in my bibliography entries</b></dt>
  <dd>This happens if you are using a Harvard style and either (a) omitted to 
  include the &quot;<font face="Arial">l</font>&quot; style flag which suppresses the label or else (b) have 
  &quot;hidden text&quot; visible. To turn off hidden text select Tools&gt;&gt;Options&gt;&gt;View 
	(Word 2003) or Office-Button&gt;&gt;Word-Options&gt;&gt;Display (Word 2007) and 
  make sure that both &quot;<font face="Arial">Hidden Text</font>&quot; and &quot;<font face="Arial">All</font>&quot; are unchecked.</dd>
  <dt><b>The /l option does not hide the labels</b></dt>
	<dd>The most common reason for the /l option apparently failing to work is 
	that &quot;hidden text&quot; has been made visible.&nbsp; To turn off hidden text 
	select Tools&gt;&gt;Options&gt;&gt;View (Word 2003) or 
	Office-Button&gt;&gt;Word-Options&gt;&gt;Display (Word 2007) and 
  make sure that both &quot;<font face="Arial">Hidden Text</font>&quot; and &quot;<font face="Arial">All</font>&quot; are unchecked.</dd>
	<dt><b>The bibliography entries are in the wrong order</b></dt>
  <dd>The order in which the bibliography is sorted is determined by the Bibtex 
  style that you have chosen to use. The majority of styles arrange the 
  bibliography alphabetically by author, but others sort by year of publication 
  or else list references in the order in which they are cited in your document. 
  A more detailed discussion is given in the <a href="b4w_using.html#Sort">user 
  guide</a>.</dd>
  <dt>The bibliography appears at the wrong place in my document</dt>
  <dd>The position of the bibliography within your document is determined by the 
  current cursor position when&nbsp; you click
  <img border="0" src="B4w_make.png" width="20" height="20">&nbsp;for the first time.
  If it is in the wrong place, select it all and delete it. Now place the cursor 
	where you want the bibliography to be and click
  <img border="0" src="B4w_make.png" width="20" height="20">&nbsp;again.</dd>
  <dt>Upper case letters are converted to lower case in the title.</dt>
  <dd>It is a quirk of BibTex that the case of letters in the title field is 
  ignored and the selected BibTex style applies its own capitalization scheme. 
  If you surround text by braces, then its case will be preserved, e.g. &quot;<font face="Arial">{UNESCO}</font>&quot;, 
  &quot;<font face="Arial">{\Delta}</font>&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="messages"></a>Error Messages</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Bibtex was unable to find style: xxx</b></dt>
  <dd>The style &quot;xxx&quot; was not available. This means that the style is either 
  (a) spelled incorrectly or else (b) that has not been installed in Miktex. To solve 
  the latter cause, open the MiKTeX package manager (<font face="Arial">Programs-&gt;MiKTeX v.v-&gt;Browse 
  Packages</font>), type &quot;<font face="Arial">xxx.bst</font>&quot; in the &quot;Filename:&quot; box and click &quot;Filter&quot;. If the 
  package has not yet been installed, the column headed &quot;Installed on&quot; will be 
  blank; right click the package and select &quot;Install&quot;. You may need to select 
  the server to download from by selecting Repository-&gt;Change Repository: select 
  &quot;Packages shall be installed from the Internet&quot;, click &quot;next&quot; and then select 
  a nearby server. It is possible to set an option so that MiKTeX downloads any 
  missing packages automatically, but I do not recommend this because it will 
  get stuck for ever if the server is not working.<br>
	If you create a new style, you need to run texhash from a command window 
  in order to update BibTeX's list of files. You can ulso update it by 
	following: <span class="style2">Programs-&gt; MikTex 2.x-&gt; Maintenance(Admin)-&gt; Settings(Admin)</span> and 
	then clicking on &quot;<span class="style2">Refresh FNDB</span>&quot;.<br>
	You can verify that style <span class="style2">xxx</span> is visible to
	<span class="style2">MikTex</span> by typing &quot;<span class="style2">kpsewhich 
	xxx.bst</span>&quot; from a command window.</dd>
  <dt><b>Compile error in hidden module: Bibtex4word</b></dt>
  <dd>(1) This error will appear if your version of Word is too old. Bibtex4Word 
  requires Word 2002 or later.<br>
  (2) This error used to happen because the macro included some non-ASCII 
  characters which would not work if the locale was set to other than West 
  European Latin. It was, I hope, fixed in V1.68.</dd>
  <dt><b>Missing Bibtex log file: ...</b></dt>
  <dd>This error means that the BibTeX program could not be found. Run bibtex 
  from a command window and check that you receive a message saying
  <font face="Arial">Need exactly one file argument</font>. If not, try 
  re-installing MikTeX. If you do get the correct response, try the solutions 
	suggested in &quot;Bad behaviour: Bibliography disappears when it is updated &quot; 
	above.</dd>
  <dt><b>Empty BBL file: ...</b></dt>
  <dd>This error may mean that the requested BibTeX style is not installed in 
	MikTex. To install it, see &quot;Error Messages: Bibtex was unable to find style: 
	xxx &quot; above.</dd>
  <dt><b>Run-time error '75': Path/file access error</b></dt>
  <dd>This error occurs if Bibtex4Word tries to use a read-only folder for its 
	temporary files. Set the environment variable BIBTEMP to a valid writable 
	folder.</dd>
  <dt><b>Run-time error '76': Path not found</b></dt>
  <dd>This error occurs if Bibtex4Word tries to use a non-existent folder for 
	its temporary files. Set the environment variable BIBTEMP to a valid 
	writable folder.</dd>
  <dt><b>The macro cannot be found or has been disabled because of your Macro 
	security settings</b></dt>
  <dd>Some users have reported this error message in Word 2010. Changing the 
	Macro security settings has no effect.Unfortunately I do not use Word 2010 
	and I have no idea what causes this message.</dd>
  <dt><b>Word has insufficient memory. You will not be able to undo this action 
  once it is completed. Do you want to continue?</b></dt>
  <dd>If you update a large bibliography, Word will issue this message to warn 
  you that it is such a large change to your document that it will not be 
  possible to undo it. You probably do not care about this, so just say &quot;Yes&quot;. 
  This problem was fixed in V1.62 by clearing the &quot;undo buffer&quot; provided that 
  style flag <font face="Arial">1z</font> is not specified.</dd>
