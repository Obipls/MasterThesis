<h2><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>A BibTeX database stores information about published references in a file 
having the extension <font face="Arial">.bib</font>. It is possible to edit the 
database file directly with a text editor but much easier to use a database 
manager such as <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">Jabref</a>. In this 
section I give an incomplete description of how to enter references aimed at 
those who are unfamiliar with BibTeX. If you know enough to disagree with 
anything I say, you know enough to make up your own mind.</p>
<p>More complete descriptions of how to use BibTeX are available online:</p>

<h2><a name="Types"></a>Publication Types</h2>
<p>A BibTeX database file contains an <i>entry</i> for each publication and can 
contain hundreds of separate entries. Some people have different database files 
for different topic areas while others, including me, find it more convenient to have one 
massive file 
containing all the publications they have ever looked at.</p>
<p>Each entry can be any one of nineteen different publication types. The most 
useful of these are</p>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>article</dt>
    <dd>a paper published in a journal</dd>
    <dt>book</dt>
    <dd>used for a book. This can be either an &quot;authored book&quot; written entirely 
    by a single group of authors or else and &quot;edited book&quot; with different 
    authors for each chapter.</dd>
    <dt>inbook</dt>
    <dd>a chapter or other section of an authored book</dd>
    <dt>incollection</dt>
    <dd>a chapter of an edited book</dd>
    <dt>inproceedings</dt>
    <dd>a paper presented at a conference</dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>
<p>To add a new entry in JabRef, you click the <font face="Arial">&quot;+&quot;</font> 
button and then select which entry type to use. If you make a mistake, you can 
change the entry type later by right clicking on an entry and selecting
<font face="Arial">Change entry type</font>.</p>
<h2><a name="Fields"></a>Fields</h2>
<p>Information about each entry is given in different fields of which the most 
important are listed below. <b>Do read through this list</b> at least once because some 
of the information is non-obvious and changing it all after entering loads of 
references is a great nuisance.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>bibtexkey</dt>
  <dd>is a short name that is used to refer to a publication within BibTeX and 
  does not usually appear in the bibliography or citation. Each entry must have 
  a unique bibtexkey that is different from all others in the database and must 
	not contain spaces or any of the following ten characters: &quot;@',\#}{~%. My 
  preference is to use the last name of the first author followed by the date of 
  publication and, if necessary to make it distinct, a letter a to z. An example 
  of this would be &quot;Einstein1905a&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>author</dt>
  <dd>A list of author names with the word &quot;<font face="Arial">and</font>&quot; between each, 
  e.g.&nbsp; <font face="Arial">John Flamsteed and Edmond Halley and James Bradley</font>. You can have as many authors as 
  you like. If you get bored, you can end the list with &quot;<font face="Arial">and others</font>&quot; but it is 
  best to enter all the names. You should put in their full names (as they 
  themselves like to be called) and let the BibTeX style choose whether to abbreviate them 
  by using only their initials (e.g. styles <font face="Arial">abbrv</font> or
  <font face="Arial">abbrvnat</font>).</dd>
  <dt>editor</dt>
  <dd>A list of editor names for &quot;edited books&quot; and, occasionally, for 
  conferences. As with the author list, multiple editors are separated by the 
  word &quot;<font face="Arial">and</font>&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>title</dt>
  <dd>gives the name of the article, chapter or book. For books, you should also 
  complete the <font face="Arial">booktitle</font> field with the same information in order to make cross 
  references work correctly. BibTeX ignores any capitalization in the title 
  field and each BibTeX style imposes its own capitalization scheme. If you put 
  braces around any acronyms as in &quot;The {NATO} Organization&quot; then the capitals 
  within the braces will be left alone.</dd>
  <dt>booktitle</dt>
  <dd>should be the same as the title field for books. For <font face="Arial">inproceedings</font> types, 
  it should be the proceedings of the conference e.g. &quot;Proc. International 
  Juggling Convention&quot;. You should include a period after abbreviations 
  unless they include the final letter of the word being abbreviated.</dd>
  <dt>journal</dt>
  <dd>gives the name of the journal containing an article</dd>
  <dt>volume</dt>
  <dd>gives the volume number for a journal</dd>
  <dt>number</dt>
  <dd>academic journals usually publish several issues in a year which make up 
  one &quot;volume&quot;; this field gives the issue number within the volume.</dd>
  <dt>pages</dt>
  <dd>gives the range of page numbers in the form &quot;23-56&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>year</dt>
  <dd>gives the year as a 4-digit number.</dd>
  <dt>month</dt>
  <dd>gives the month. In JabRef, this should <b>always</b> be entered as a 3 letter 
  lower-case abbreviation surrounded by hash signs, e.g. #jan#. The BibTeX style 
  will convert this into the appropriate form for the bibliography.</dd>
  <dt>address</dt>
  <dd>for <font face="Arial">inproceedings</font> entries, it is normal to give the name of the city 
  that hosted the conference. For <font face="Arial">book</font> entries, some people like to include the 
  publisher's city.</dd>
  <dt>crossref</dt>
  <dd>for the <font face="Arial">inbook</font> and <font face="Arial">incollection</font> types of publication, you should first 
  make an entry for the complete book and then type its <font face="Arial">bibtexkey</font> in the 
  <font face="Arial">crossref</font> field of any <font face="Arial">inbook</font> and 
  <font face="Arial">incollection</font> entries that refer to part of 
  the book. It is 
  then not necessary to re-enter any information (e.g. publisher and date of 
  publication) that is the same for all sections of the book.</dd>
  <dt>doi</dt>
  <dd>a short string, looking something like 10.1109/CVPR.2006.95, that uniquely 
  identifies a publication and that is guaranteed by the publisher never to 
  change. Several styles (e.g. <font face="Arial">plainnat</font>, 
  <font face="Arial">abbrvnat</font>) will convert this into a 
  clickable hyperlink if the <font face="Arial">d </font>style flag is specified.</dd>
  <dt>url</dt>
  <dd>a web link pointing to the publication. These are not as good as doi links 
  because they often change over time.</dd>
  <dt>isbn</dt>
  <dd>gives the ISBN number for a book.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="Names"></a>Entering Names</h2>
<p>There are three ways of entering names which are distinguished by the number 
of commas included (zero, one or two):</p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Dwight D. Eisenhower</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Eisenhower, Dwight D.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Davis, Jr., Sammy</font></li>
</ol>
<p>You need to use the last form for names that include a suffix like &quot;Jr.&quot; but 
otherwise, I prefer the first. Initials should be followed by a period 
and a space, i.e. write &quot;<font face="Arial">J. B. Priestly</font>&quot; rather than &quot;<font face="Arial">JB 
Priestly</font>&quot; or &quot;<font face="Arial">J.B.Priestly</font>&quot;. Aristocratic names 
should be written &quot;<font face="Arial">Ludwig van Beethoven</font>&quot; or &quot;<font face="Arial">van 
Beethoven, Jr., Ludwig</font>&quot; if they also have a &quot;<font face="Arial">Jr.</font>&quot; 
suffix.</p>
<p>BibTeX does not deal properly with names in which the family name comes 
first. These should be surrounded with braces as in&nbsp; &quot;{Mao Zedong}&quot; in 
order to ensure that their order is not reversed and that the family name is 
used when sorting the list of authors.</p>
<h2><a name="Strings"></a>Strings</h2>
<p>Jabref allows you to define <i>strings</i> that can abbreviate commonly used 
journal names. Click BibTeX&gt;&gt;Edit Strings&gt;&gt;+ to enter a new abbreviation e.g. &quot;<font face="Arial">IJFC</font>&quot; 
for the &quot;<font face="Arial">Proc. International Juggling Federation 
Convention</font>&quot;. Once defined, you can enter <font face="Arial">#IJFC#</font> 
instead of the full name which is quicker and saves spelling errors.</p>
<h2><a name="Special"></a>Special Characters</h2>
<p>Bibtex4Word can generate non-standard characters in several different ways. 
Most of these are illustrated in the document &quot;<font face="Arial">SpecialCharacters.doc</font>&quot; 
that is included in the Bibtex4Word distribution.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The easiest way is to save your BibTeX file using
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoding (this can be 
  set in the Jabref preferences dialog) and specify the <font face="Arial">p</font> 
  style flag so that Bibtex4Word reads it correctly.</li>
  <li>Non-standard characters that are available in your locale's
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page">ANSI code page</a> will be reproduced correctly 
  if the <font face="Arial">p</font> style flag is omitted or if
  <font face="Arial">0p</font> is specified. These can be entered from your keyboard by typing
  <font face="Arial">ALT+0xxx</font> where <font face="Arial">xxx</font> is the 
  decimal character code that you want in the range 129 to 255. Code page 1252 
  is the Western European standard and is illustrated in the examples in &quot;<font face="Arial">SpecialCharacters.doc</font>&quot;.</li>
  <li>Many characters have special &quot;escape sequences&quot; defined in LaTeX. Thus, &quot;<font face="Arial">\infty</font>&quot; 
  will create an infinity symbol. Bibtex4Word will correctly interpret most but 
  not all of the sequences shown
  <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/latex_advanced/node14.html">
  here</a>.</li>
  <li>Accents on letters also have special &quot;escape sequences&quot; which are listed
  <a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-401.html">
  here</a>. For reasons that are explained
  <a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/bibtex/tamethebeast/ttb_en.pdf">
  here</a>, you need to enclose accented characters in names and titles within 
  braces e.g. &quot;<font face="Arial">{\&quot;a}</font>&quot; for an a with an umlaut or 
  within double braces to protect them from case changes in titles e.g. &quot;<font face="Arial">{{\&quot;A}}</font>&quot;. 
  </li>
  <li>Mathematical formulae are enclosed in braces and $ signs and use _ and ^ 
  for subscript and superscript respectively: &quot;<font face="Arial">{$a^2+b^2=c^2$}</font>&quot;. 
  </li>
  <li>Unicode characters can be entered 
  with the escape sequence &quot;<font face="Arial">\unichar{xxx}</font>&quot; where
  <font face="Arial">xxx</font> is the decimal code for a character.</li>
