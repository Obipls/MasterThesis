<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Bibtex4Word is an add-in for Microsoft Word that allows the citation of 
references and the insertion of a bibliography into your document using your 
choice of formatting style. It is lightweight, transparent and does not mess up 
your documents. It is intended for three types of user:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Word users who cannot afford a commercial bibliography package but need to 
  insert citations and bibliographies into their documents. Everything you need 
  to manage references is available free. There are hundreds of pre-defined 
  formatting styles and it is very likely that one of these will match your needs 
  precisely.</li>
  <li>Word users who have a commercial bibliography package but who do not like 
  it.</li>
  <li>LateX users who need to use Microsoft Word. Bibtex4Word allows you to use 
  your existing BibTeX database and favourite bibliography style.</li>
</ol>
<p>To use Bibtex4Word, you must be using a PC (it does not work on a Mac) 
running Word 2002 or later (32 or 64 bit) and you need to 
install three pieces of free software:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A reference manager that will allow you to enter, or download, the 
  citation details of a published document and which stores them in BibTeX 
  format. There are several suitable reference managers available; I strongly 
  recommend JabRef .</li>
  <li>The MikTeX wordprocessing package. This is a PC implementation of a 
  wordprocessor called LateX&nbsp; which includes the BibTeX program as one of 
  its components. We only use a tiny part of MikTeX but it is easiest to install 
  the whole package.</li>
  <li>The Bibtex4Word macro itself.</li>
</ol>
